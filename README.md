# Optional Parameters
 C# provides a syntax for optional (or "default") parameters, this is me learning them.
 
Write a method that takes two optional parameters.
Manually write out the method you created in #1, this time using overloaded functions rather than optional parameters.
Using your own words in a comment at the top of your .cs file, describe "syntactic sugar".
